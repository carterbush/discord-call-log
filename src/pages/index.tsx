            This is a webapp to help people get a list of calls between two
            people from a Discord package. I can't guarantee complete
            correctness, and if you have situations where you've had group calls
            that might show up weirdly, but it was enough for my partner and I
            to get our visa!

            This app doesn't communicate with a server, so your data is safely
            in your own browser - this app is just here to help you out. The
            code for this app is publicly available on my GitHub, linked above.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            If this tool helped you out and you're feeling generous, you can
            also buy me a coffee - also linked above.
